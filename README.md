# Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Prediction
## Problem Statement
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease primarily plaguing the elderly and it has
been a growing public health concern, with prevalence expected to increase 3-fold by 2050. The main
reason why Alzheimer’s Disease is such a big issue is because there are currently no cures, only licensed
treatments to alleviate symptoms, and it gets exponentially worse with time. Therefore, it is crucial
that Alzheimer’s Disease is diagnosed as early as possible to slow down cognitive decline.

## Objective
The aim of this analysis is to develop a model that can accurately predict Alzheimer’s Disease diagnosis
using relevant information regarding the patient.
